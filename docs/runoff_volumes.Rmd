```

In a code chunk in your runoff_volumes.Rmd, use your predict_runoff function to estimate stormwater volume for a watershed of 182 acres, over a range of estimates for the impervious fraction (from 0.6 to 0.8, by increments of 0.01). Note: you do not need to write a for loop here.

```{r}
i_seq <- seq(from = 0.6, to = 0.8, by = 0.01)
new_runoff <- predict_runoff(A = 182, IA =i_seq )
#make it a dataframe
runoff_df <-data.frame(i_seq,new_runoff)
runoff_plot <-ggplot(runoff_df, aes(x = i_seq, y = new_runoff)) + geom_point() + geom_line() + labs( title = " Groundwater Runoff", x = "Fraction of watershed impervious", y = "Volume of expected runoff (ft3)")
ggsave(here("figs","runoffplot.png"))


```
